    <h2>Current System vs. A Better Way</h2>
    <div class="compare">
      <div>
        <h4>The Current Path</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>At 18, you're expected to go to college — often without knowing why.</li>
          <li>You’re asked, “What do you want to do for four years?” — not, “What do you want to do with your life?”</li>
          <li>If your grades are bad, you may be locked out of opportunities — even if you're passionate about them.</li>
          <li>If you succeed, it becomes your permanent career — even if you're unhappy.</li>
          <li>If you fail, you're judged harshly, even though failure is often the beginning of true growth.</li>
          <li>Emotional tolls like depression and anxiety are ignored — or worse, normalized.</li>
          <li>You're judged for being different, and your life is shaped by people who don’t know you.</li>
          <li>Conformity is rewarded. Individuality is punished.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>A Healthier Alternative</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>At 18, you're asked: “What excites you?” or “What kind of life do you want to build?”</li>
          <li>Grades don’t define your potential — effort, curiosity, and passion do.</li>
          <li>If your goal requires school and you’re motivated, pursue it. If not, self-teach or explore alternatives.</li>
          <li>If you're failing in school, it’s not the end — it may be the beginning of something better.</li>
          <li>You can still build a meaningful life outside of traditional education.</li>
          <li>Success becomes personal and diverse — not tied to wealth, status, or grades.</li>
          <li>There's no shame in switching paths, taking breaks, or doing things your own way.</li>
          <li>People thrive by doing what they love and what they’re naturally good at — and society benefits from that joy and excellence.</li>
